## v3.3.1 (2016-03-25)

- Only install the aws-sdk gem at compile_time if chef-client supports that

## v3.3.0 (2016-03-25)

- The AWS gem is now automatically installed as needed by the providers

## v3.2.0 (2016-03-23)

- Add the :delete action to the ebs_volume provider

## v3.1.0 (2016-03-22)

- Added the sensitive attribute to the s3_file provider
- s3_file provider now compares md5sums of local files against those in S3 to determine if the file should be downloaded during the chef-client run
- s3_file provider now properly handles region by defaulting to us-east-1 unless a region is provided in the resource
- An inspec test suite has been added for the s3_file provider
- s3 connection objects are no longer stored in a per-region hash as this is longer necessary with the changes to how connection objects are stored
- The region method in the S3 module has been removed as it wasn't being used after region handling refactoring in the 3.0 release

## v3.0.0 (2016-03-20)

### Breaking changes:

- Removed the ability to use databags for credentials with the ebs_raid provider. You must now pass the credentials in via the resource, [@tas50]
- [#218] Remove support for Chef < 11.6.0, [@tas50]
- Switched to Ohai to gather information on the AWS instance instead of direct AWS metadata calls. This also removes the node['region'] attribute, which is no longer necessary. If you would like to mock the region for some reason in local testing set `node['ec2']['placement_availability_zone']` to the AZ, as this is used to determine the region, [@tas50]
- aws-sdk gem is no longer loaded in default recipe
