# aws Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/aws) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/aws.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/aws)

This cookbook includes resources and providers to configure and manage Amazon Web Services components and offerings with the EC2 API. Currently supported resources:

- EBS Volumes (`ebs_volume`)
- EBS Raid (`ebs_raid`)
- Elastic IPs (`elastic_ip`)
- Elastic Load Balancer (`elastic_lb`)
- AWS Resource Tags (`resource_tag`)
- Secondary IPs (`secondary_ip`)
- AWS Cloudwatch Instance Monitoring (`aws_instance_monitoring`)
- CloudFormation Stack Management (`cloudformation_stack`)
- Kinesis Stream Management (`kinesis_stream`)
- IAM User, Group, Policy, and Role Management:

  - (`iam_user`)
  - (`iam_group`)
  - (`iam_policy`)
  - (`iam_role`)

Unsupported AWS resources that have other cookbooks include but are not limited to:

- [Route53](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/route53)
- [aws_security](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/aws_security)

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Any platform supported by Chef and the AWS-SDK

### Chef

- Chef 11.6+

### Cookbooks

- Ohai 2.1.0+

## Credentials

In order to manage AWS components, authentication credentials need to be available to the node. There are 3 ways to handle this:

1. explicitly pass credentials parameter to the resource
2. use the credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file
3. let the resource pick up credentials from the IAM role assigned to the instance

**Also new** resources can now assume an STS role, with support for MFA as well. Instructions are below in the relevant section.

### Using resource parameters

In order to pass the credentials to the resource, credentials must be available to the node. There are a number of ways to handle this, such as node attributes applied to the node or via Chef roles/environments.

We recommend storing these in an encrypted databag, and loading them in the recipe where the resources are used.

Example Data Bag:

```json
% knife data bag show aws main
{
  "id": "main",
  "aws_access_key_id": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
  "aws_session_token": "YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
}
```

This can be loaded in a recipe with:

```ruby
aws = data_bag_item('aws', 'main')
```

And to access the values:

```ruby
aws['aws_access_key_id']
aws['aws_secret_access_key']
aws['aws_session_token']
```

We'll look at specific usage below.

### Using local credentials

If credentials are not supplied via parameters, resources will look for the credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = ACCESS_KEY
```

Note that this also accepts other profiles if they are supplied via the `ENV['AWS_PROFILE']` environment variable.

### Using IAM instance role

If your instance has an IAM role, then the credentials can be automatically resolved by the cookbook using Amazon instance metadata API.

You can then omit the resource parameters `aws_secret_access_key` and `aws_access_key`.

Of course, the instance role must have the required policies. Here is a sample policy for EBS volume management:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:AttachVolume",
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:ModifyVolumeAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumeAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumeStatus",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
        "ec2:DetachVolume",
        "ec2:EnableVolumeIO"
      ],
      "Sid": "Stmt1381536011000",
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

For resource tags:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DescribeTags"
      ],
      "Sid": "Stmt1381536708000",
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Assuming roles via STS and using MFA

The following is an example of how roles can be assumed using MFA. The following can also be used to assumes roles that do not require MFA, just ensure that the MFA arguments (`serial_number` and `token_code`) are omitted.

This assumes you have also stored the `cfn_role_arn`, and `mfa_serial` attributes as well, but there are plenty of ways these attributes can be supplied (they could be stored locally in the consuming cookbook, for example).

Note that MFA codes cannot be recycled, hence the importance of creating a single STS session and passing that to resources. If multiple roles need to be assumed using MFA, it is probably prudent that these be broken up into different recipes and `chef-client` runs.

```ruby
require 'aws-sdk'
require 'securerandom'

session_id = SecureRandom.hex(8)
sts = ::Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials.new(
  client: ::Aws::STS::Client.new(
    credentials: ::Aws::Credentials.new(
      node['aws']['aws_access_key_id'],
      node['aws']['aws_secret_access_key']
    ),
    region: 'us-east-1'
  ),
  role_arn: node['aws']['cfn_role_arn'],
  role_session_name: session_id,
  serial_number: node['aws']['mfa_serial'],
  token_code: node['aws']['mfa_code']
)

aws_cloudformation_stack 'kitchen-test-stack' do
  action :create
  template_source 'kitchen-test-stack.tpl'
  aws_access_key sts.access_key_id
  aws_secret_access_key sts.secret_access_key
  aws_session_token sts.session_token
end
```

When running the cookbook, ensure that an attribute JSON is passed that supplies the MFA code. Example using chef-zero:

```
echo '{ "aws": { "mfa_code": "123456" } }' > mfa.json && chef-client -z -o 'recipe[aws_test]' -j mfa.json
```

### Running outside of an AWS instance

`region` can be specified if the cookbook is being run outside of an AWS instance. This can prevent some kinds of failures that happen when resources try to detect region.

```ruby
aws_cloudformation_stack 'kitchen-test-stack' do
  action :create
  template_source 'kitchen-test-stack.tpl'
  region 'us-east-1'
end
```

## Recipes

### default.rb

This recipe is empty. In previous releases it installed the aws-sdk gem, but this is now performed automatically in the providers.

### ec2_hints.rb

This recipe is used to setup the EC2 hints for Ohai in the case that an instance is not created using knife-ec2.

## Usage

The following examples assume that the recommended data bag item has been created and that the following has been included at the top of the recipe where they are used.

```ruby
include_recipe 'aws'
aws = data_bag_item('aws', 'main')
```

### aws_ebs_volume

The resource only handles manipulating the EBS volume, additional resources need to be created in the recipe to manage the attached volume as a filesystem or logical volume.

```ruby
aws_ebs_volume 'db_ebs_volume' do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  size 50
  device '/dev/sdi'
  action [:create, :attach]
end
```

This will create a 50G volume, attach it to the instance as `/dev/sdi`.

```ruby
aws_ebs_volume 'db_ebs_volume_from_snapshot' do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  size 50
  device '/dev/sdi'
  snapshot_id 'snap-ABCDEFGH'
  action [:create, :attach]
end
```

This will create a new 50G volume from the snapshot ID provided and attach it as `/dev/sdi`.

### aws_elastic_ip

The `elastic_ip` resource provider does not support allocating new IPs. This must be done before running a recipe that uses the resource. After allocating a new Elastic IP, we recommend storing it in a databag and loading the item in the recipe.

Databag structure:

```json
% knife data bag show aws eip_load_balancer_production
{
  "id": "eip_load_balancer_production",
  "public_ip": "YOUR_ALLOCATED_IP"
}
```

Then to set up the Elastic IP on a system:

```ruby
ip_info = data_bag_item('aws', 'eip_load_balancer_production')

aws_elastic_ip 'eip_load_balancer_production' do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  ip ip_info['public_ip']
  action :associate
end
```

This will use the loaded `aws` and `ip_info` databags to pass the required values into the resource to configure. Note that when associating an Elastic IP to an instance, connectivity to the instance will be lost because the public IP address is changed. You will need to reconnect to the instance with the new IP.

You can also store this in a role as an attribute or assign to the node directly, if preferred.

### aws_elastic_lb

`elastic_lb` functions similarly to `elastic_ip`. Make sure that you've created the ELB and enabled your instances' availability zones prior to using this provider.

For example, to register the node in the 'QA' ELB:

```ruby
aws_elastic_lb 'elb_qa' do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  name 'QA'
  action :register
end
```

### aws_resource_tag

`resource_tag` can be used to manipulate the tags assigned to one or more AWS resources, i.e. ec2 instances, ebs volumes or ebs volume snapshots.

Assigning tags to a node to reflect its role and environment:

```ruby
aws_resource_tag node['ec2']['instance_id'] do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  tags('Name' => 'www.example.com app server',
       'Environment' => node.chef_environment)
  action :update
end
```

Assigning a set of tags to multiple resources, e.g. ebs volumes in a disk set:

```ruby
aws_resource_tag 'my awesome raid set' do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  resource_id ['vol-d0518cb2', 'vol-fad31a9a', 'vol-fb106a9f', 'vol-74ed3b14']
  tags('Name' => 'My awesome RAID disk set',
       'Environment' => node.chef_environment)
end
```

```ruby
aws_resource_tag 'db_ebs_volume' do
  resource_id lazy { node['aws']['ebs_volume']['db_ebs_volume']['volume_id'] }
  tags ({ 'Service' => 'Frontend' })
end
```

### aws_s3_file

`s3_file` can be used to download a file from s3 that requires aws authorization. This is a wrapper around the core chef `remote_file` resource and supports the same resource attributes as `remote_file`. See [remote_file Chef Docs] (<https://docs.chef.io/resource_remote_file.html>) for a complete list of available attributes.

```ruby
aws_s3_file '/tmp/foo' do
  bucket 'i_haz_an_s3_buckit'
  remote_path 'path/in/s3/bukket/to/foo'
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  region 'us-west-1'
end
```

## aws_instance_monitoring

Allows detailed CloudWatch monitoring to be enabled for the current instance.

```ruby
aws_instance_monitoring "enable detailed monitoring"
```

## aws_secondary_ip

The `secondary_ip` resource provider allows one to assign/unassign multiple private secondary IPs on an instance in EC2-VPC. The number of secondary IP addresses that you can assign to an instance varies by instance type. If no ip address is provided on assign, a random one from within the subnet will be assigned. If no interface is provided, the default interface (which is pulled from Ohai) will be used.

```ruby
aws_secondary_ip "assign_additional_ip" do
  aws_access_key aws['aws_access_key_id']
  aws_secret_access_key aws['aws_secret_access_key']
  ip ip_info['private_ip']
  interface 'eth0'
  action :assign
end
```

## aws_cloudformation_stack

Manage CloudFormation stacks with Chef.

Example:

```ruby
aws_cloudformation_stack 'example-stack' do
  region 'us-east-1'
  template_source 'example-stack.tpl'

  parameters ([
    {
      :parameter_key => 'KeyPair',
      :parameter_value => 'user@host'
    },
    {
      :parameter_key => 'SSHAllowIPAddress',
      :parameter_value => '127.0.0.1/32'
    }
  ])
end
```

Actions:

- `create`: Creates the stack, or updates it if it already exists.
- `delete`: Begins the deletion process for the stack.

Attribute parameters are:

- `template_source`: Required - the location of the CloudFormation template file. The file should be stored in the `files` directory in the cookbook.
- `parameters`: An array of `parameter_key` and `parameter_value` pairs for parameters in the template. Follow the syntax in the example above.
- `disable_rollback`: Set this to `true` if you want stack rollback to be disabled if creation of the stack fails. Default: `false`
- `stack_policy_body`: Optionally define a stack policy to apply to the stack, mainly used in protecting stack resources after they are created. For more information, see [Prevent Updates to Stack Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) in the CloudFormation user guide.
- `iam_capability`: Set to `true` to allow the CloudFormation template to create IAM resources. This is the equivalent of setting `CAPABILITY_IAM` When using the SDK or CLI. Default: `false`

## aws_dynamodb_table

Use this resource to create and delete DynamoDB tables. This includes the ability to add global secondary indexes to existing tables.

```ruby
aws_dynamodb_table 'example-table' do
  action :create
  attribute_definitions [
    { attribute_name: 'Id', attribute_type: 'N' },
    { attribute_name: 'Foo', attribute_type: 'N' },
    { attribute_name: 'Bar', attribute_type: 'N' },
    { attribute_name: 'Baz', attribute_type: 'S' }
  ]
  key_schema [
    { attribute_name: 'Id', key_type: 'HASH' },
    { attribute_name: 'Foo', key_type: 'RANGE' }
  ]
  local_secondary_indexes [
    {
      index_name: 'BarIndex',
      key_schema: [
        {
          attribute_name: 'Id',
          key_type: 'HASH'
        },
        {
          attribute_name: 'Bar',
          key_type: 'RANGE'
        }
      ],
      projection: {
        projection_type: 'ALL'
      }
    }
  ]
  global_secondary_indexes [
    {
      index_name: 'BazIndex',
      key_schema: [{
        attribute_name: 'Baz',
        key_type: 'HASH'
      }],
      projection: {
        projection_type: 'ALL'
      },
      provisioned_throughput: {
        read_capacity_units: 1,
        write_capacity_units: 1
      }
    }
  ]
  provisioned_throughput ({
    read_capacity_units: 1,
    write_capacity_units: 1
  })
  stream_specification ({
    stream_enabled: true,
    stream_view_type: 'KEYS_ONLY'
  })
end
```

Actions:

- `create`: Creates the table. Will update the following if the table exists:

  - `global_secondary_indexes`: Will remove non-existent indexes, add new ones, and update throughput for existing ones. All attributes need to be present in `attribute_definitions`. No effect if the resource is omitted.
  - `stream_specification`: Will update as shown. No effect is the resource is omitted.
  - `provisioned_throughput`: Will update as shown.

- `delete`: Deletes the index.

Attributes:

- `attribute_definitions`: Required. Attributes to create for the table. Mainly this is used to specify attributes that are used in keys, as otherwise one can add any attribute they want to a DynamoDB table.
- `key_schema`: Required. Used to create the primary key for the table. Attributes need to be present in `attribute_definitions`.
- `local_secondary_indexes`: Used to create any local secondary indexes for the table. Attributes need to be present in `attribute_definitions`.
- `global_secondary_indexes`: Used to create any global secondary indexes. Can be done to an existing table. Attributes need to be present in
- `attribute_definitions`.
- `provisioned_throughput`: Define the throughput for this table.
- `stream_specification`: Specify if there should be a stream for this table.

Several of the attributes shown here take parameters as shown in the [AWS Ruby SDK Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/DynamoDB/Client.html#create_table-instance_method). Also, the [AWS DynamoDB Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) may be of further help as well.

## aws_kinesis_stream

Use this resource to create and delete Kinesis streams. Note that this resource cannot be used to modify the shard count as shard splitting is a somewhat complex operation (for example, even CloudFormation replaces streams upon update).

```ruby
aws_kinesis_stream 'example-stream' do
 action :create
 starting_shard_count 1
end
```

Actions:

- `create`: Creates the stream. No effect if the stream already exists.
- `delete`: Deletes the stream.

Use `starting_shard_count` to control the amount of shards the stream starts with.

## aws_iam_user

Use this resource to manage IAM users.

```ruby
aws_iam_user 'example-user' do
  action :create
  path '/'
end
```

Actions:

- `create`: Creates the user. No effect if the user already exists.
- `delete`: Gracefully deletes the user (detaches from all attached entities, and deletes the user).

The IAM user takes the name of the resource. A `path` can be specified as well. For more information about paths, see [IAM Identifiers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) in the Using IAM guide.

## aws_iam_group

Use this resource to manage IAM groups. The group takes the name of the resource.

aws_iam_group 'example-group' do
  action :create
  path '/'
  members [
    'example-user'
  ]
  remove_members true
  policy_members [
    'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/example-policy'
  ]
  remove_policy_members true
end
```

- `create`: Creates the group, and updates members and attached policies if the group already exists.
- `delete`: Gracefully deletes the group (detaches from all attached entities, and deletes the group).

Attribute parameters are:

- `path`: A path can be supplied for the group. For information on paths, see [IAM Identifiers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) in the Using IAM guide.
- `members`: An array of IAM users that are a member of this group.
- `remove_members`: Set to `false` to ensure that members are not removed from the group when they are not present in the defined resource. Default: `true`
- `policy_members`: An array of ARNs of IAM managed policies to attach to this resource. Accepts both user-defined and AWS-defined policy ARNs.
- `remove_policy_members`: Set to `false` to ensure that policies are not detached from the group when they are not present in the defined resource. Default: `true`

## aws_iam_policy

  action :create
  path '/'
  account_id '123456789012'
  policy_document <<-EOH.gsub(/^ {4}/, '')
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",

                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example-role"
                ]

Actions:

- `create`: Creates or updates the policy.
- `delete`: Gracefully deletes the policy (detaches from all attached entities, deletes all non-default policy versions, then deletes the policy).

Attribute parameters are:

- `path`: A path can be supplied for the group. For information on paths, see [IAM Identifiers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) in the Using IAM guide.
- `policy_document`: The JSON document for the policy.
- `account_id`: The AWS account ID that the policy is going in. Required if using non-user credentials (ie: IAM role through STS or instance role).

## aws_iam_role

Use this resource to create an IAM role. The policy takes the name of the resource.

```ruby
aws_iam_role 'example-role' do
  action :create
  path '/'
  policy_members [
    'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/example-policy'
  ]
  remove_policy_members true
  assume_role_policy_document <<-EOH.gsub(/^ {4}/, '')
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "",
          "Effect": "Deny",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
  EOH
end
```

- `create`: Creates the role if it does not exist. If the role exists, updates attached policies and the `assume_role_policy_document`.
- `delete`: Gracefully deletes the role (detaches from all attached entities, and deletes the role).

Attribute parameters are:

- `path`: A path can be supplied for the group. For information on paths, see [IAM Identifiers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) in the Using IAM guide.
- `policy_members`: An array of ARNs of IAM managed policies to attach to this resource. Accepts both user-defined and AWS-defined policy ARNs.
- `remove_policy_members`: Set to `false` to ensure that policies are not detached from the group when they are not present in the defined resource. Default: `true`
- `assume_role_policy_document`: The JSON policy document to apply to this role for trust relationships. Dictates what entities can assume this role.
